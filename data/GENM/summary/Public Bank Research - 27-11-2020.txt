 Genting Malaysia reported an RM704.6m net loss for 3Q FY20, compared to a profit of RM410.8m in 3QFY19. This was largely due to the impact of Covid-19 which resulted in its resumed operations running at reduced capacity. Empire Resorts remained a loss-making associate, posting a loss of RM62m.

3QFY20 revenue dropped 46% YoY due to a decline in business volume for all its leisure & hospitality operations in the UK, US and Malaysia following the coronavirus pandemic. Malaysia, UK & Egypt and US & Bahamas operations suffered 34%, 68% and 80% drop in revenue. On a QoQ basis, revenue saw a sharp recovery from RM115m in 2QF20 to RM1,417m.

The worst is over with full lockdown on economies not likely to recur, but earnings are only expected to recover slowly . We reckon the impact of economic fallout on consumer sentiment should continue to affect consumer sentiment . As such, we think full recovery is more plausible in FY2022F.
