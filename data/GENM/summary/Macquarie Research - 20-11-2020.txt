Macquarie Equities Research says recoveries in Asia-Pacific local gaming consumption bodes well for Genting Malaysia. The Street is forecasting 3Q Malaysia revenues -44% year on year (YoY) despite domestic players contributing two-thirds of pre-COVID visitation.

MQ Research believes Malaysia EBITDA ramped well throughout 3Q, but COVID related restrictions placed in Oct will likely pause momentum. Since reopening on Sept 9, RWNYC has already demonstrated a V-shaped recovery. US and UK iGaming is expected to rebound quickly after reopening, as OpEx cuts offset slightly lower revs.

MQ Research sees GENM as among the top value/recovery plays, where investors will be compensated with a 7.5% dividend yield. Shares remain 19% below pre-COVID levels (KLCI +3%) but have rerated 26% MTD alongside vaccine progress.
