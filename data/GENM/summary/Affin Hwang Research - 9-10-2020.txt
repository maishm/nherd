We maintain our SELL call on Genting Malaysia (GENM), cut the EPS for 21/22E by -11.8%/1.7% and reduce our TP to RM1.80. We believe that the current visitation is likely to drop off after the initial excitement post opening.

Malaysia has also put their plans to be part of travel bubbles on hold after a spike in cases around the world . We are expecting a full recovery of tourists by 2024. We are only expecting to recover 6-12 months after a vaccine is publicly available. As such, a lack of clarity on the effectiveness of a vaccine might not be sufficient to achieve community protection.

Most of GENM’s UK and US operations have resumed operation, but we are not expecting them to turn profitable soon, as the recent surges in COVID-19 cases have forced governments to implement more stringent restrictions . Although its New York casinos have resumed operations, they were only allowed to operate at 25% capacity.
