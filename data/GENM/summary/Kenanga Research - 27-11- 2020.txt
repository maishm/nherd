9MFY20 core loss of RM1.28b was higher than house/street’s FY20 net loss forecast of RM740.6m/RM824.3m . Rating is cut to MP with a lower TP of RM2.60. 2021 will be a recovery year before ‘business as usual’ in 2022.

Revenue soared 11x QoQ to RM1.42b from RM0.11b after reopening in Malaysia and UK. This helped reduce core loss to RM434.6m from RM793.2m previously. UK and North America units still posted adjusted LBITDA with narrowed losses.

We believe the recent strong price rebound has priced in the earnings recovery. Risk to our call is slower-than-expected recovery in business volume from business disruption. We downgrade the stock to MP from OP with a lower target price of RM2.60, post earnings revision.
