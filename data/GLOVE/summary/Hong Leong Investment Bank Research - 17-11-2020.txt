Top Glove has been imposed with a 14 day EMCO on its workers’ dormitories from 17-30 Nov. We are slightly negative on the news, as this can be reasonably expected to disrupt production during the 2 week EMCO period. Separately, news flow on the vaccine development (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna) has been gaining traction . We lower our PE target from 16x to 14x (reflecting -1.5SD below 5Y mean, from -1SD previously), still tagged to FY21 EPS.

The 2 dormitories comprise c.2.5k workers, or 16% of Top Glove’s total factory workers. We decrease our FY21 earnings by -3.8% to reflect in the temporary disruption. With the hype on vaccine, we maintain BUY, TP: RM10.95.

We lower our PE target from 16x to 14x (reflecting -1.5SD below 5Y mean, from -1SD previously), still tagged to FY21 EPS . Alongside with earnings adjustments, TP decreases to RM10.95 (from RM13.00) We still think there is sufficient buffer to warrant BUY rating.
