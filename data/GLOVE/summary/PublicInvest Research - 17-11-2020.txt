Following a spike of Covid-19 cases in Meru, Klang, Top Glove’s workers dormitory and its surrounding area will be placed under an Enhanced Movement Control Order (EMCO), starting 17th November, for 14 days. This restriction will affect 2.5k factory workers, representing c.15% of its total factory workforce across the Group. Operations at the factories are expected to be carried out as per usual, despite lesser manpower.

Top Glove might also hire local part time workers to help make up for the worker shortage. Should the outbreak situation in the vicinity worsens, affecting more workers and leading into an even more severe global glove shortage, we think ASPs could increase further, resulting in an eventual expansion of profit margin.
