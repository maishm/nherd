AAGB continues to be severely hit following a slew of Covid-19 triggered events which have highly impacted its business operations during the year . This resulted in AAGB recording a 3QFY20 normalised net loss of –RM1.3b (-34%qoq and -638%yoy)

Key operating statistics have improved tremendously compared to last quarter . RPK, ASK, and passengers carried saw multifold increase, all more than >+100%qoq. We can expect similar performance to persist in 4Q20 due to unabated pandemic pandemic.

AAGB will continue to operate in challenging environment amidst ravaging pandemic, border control and other measures that remains unconducive for airline business. Operationally, we are expecting a decline instead of growth across the board, below FY19 level. We are slashing our FY20E from core net losses of -RM2.7b to – RM3.35b, -24% lower due to higher than expected losses for 3QFY20.

We believe AAGB is poised to survive this pandemic with stringent cost control and continue innovation of its business model. We upgrade our call to NEUTRAL from Trading Sell to account for the expected recovery of air travel demands in 2H21.
